                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It consists of a set of elements or tags that are used to define the structure and content of a web page. HTML documents are created using a plain text editor or specialized web development software. The basic structure of an HTML document includes the DOCTYPE declaration, HTML root element, head element, and body element. HTML allows web developers to create interactive and dynamic websites by incorporating other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It allows web developers to separate the content and structure of a web page from its visual presentation. CSS enables developers to define styles for HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and more. Styles can be applied to a single element or to multiple elements at once. CSS files are typically saved separately from HTML documents and linked to them using the link tag in the HTML head section.

                JavaScript is a scripting language used primarily for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It runs on the client-side, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser. JavaScript allows developers to add functionality to web pages, such as form validation, animations, and event handling. It is an object-oriented language that supports functions, arrays, and objects, among other features. JavaScript code is typically embedded directly into HTML documents using the script tag or saved in separate files and linked to HTML documents. It is a widely used language for web development and is supported by all modern web browsers.
